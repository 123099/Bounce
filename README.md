# Bounce
Bounce - Minecraft minigame plugin for Battleaxe, a private minecraft server.

## Description
The minigame is a PvP between mutliple players with various abilities, like dash slashes, that are constantly getting bounced around by the ground blocks below them.

The plugin depends on an internal Battleaxe server tool for certain features, like money, so it cannot be run on its own as it is.
